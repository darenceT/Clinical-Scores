# Clinical-Scores

Anyone especially clinicians are welcomed to use and give feedback.

This is my ongoing project to improve documentation efficiency during patient care. 

Hopefully down the road I can infuse more data into clinical tools.

To use these files you will need to do the following:

1. install python

2. install pip (optional)

3. install klembord. Easiest way is using pip: "pip install klembord"

4. run file through terminal/command prompt: python filename.py


Please feel free to contact me for any questions, feedback or suggestions.
